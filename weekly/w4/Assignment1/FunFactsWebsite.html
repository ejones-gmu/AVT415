                        <p>The Nike Dunk High was released in August 1985 as a 
                            high-top basketball sneaker, having been crafted out of 
                            four earlier Nike models – the Air Force 1, the Terminator, 
                            the Air Jordan 1 and the Legend. The AF-1 inspired the 
                            Dunk’s overall look – the outsole borrowing the same traction 
                            as the AF-1 – the upper was a merging of the AJ-1 and the 
                            Terminator, and the Legend was used to help create the molds 
                            for the Dunk. The Nike Dunk’s predecessors helped form 
                            the silhouette’s final shape, but the backstory behind 
                            the sneaker’s very first release was what gave it its unique charm.</p>
                            
                        <p>The shoe’s 1985 release coincided – and not coincidentally – 
                            with the golden age of basketball and its spot lit star, 
                            Michael Jordan. Being designed to accommodate basketball 
                            tactics and moves such as pivoting and blocking, the Nike 
                            Dunk became an instant success within the sport upon 
                            release – on its technical parameters that is. Truly, the 
                            1985 Nike Dunk High became famous for something a little 
                            bit more colorful and symbolic than this, dubbed “Be True 
                            To Your School”.</p>
                            
                        <p>“Be True To Your School” was Nike’s first attempt at 
                            marketing the Nike Dunk. It offered Division I college 
                            basketball teams and their respective fans a way to don 
                            their team’s colors. Each Dunk iteration focused on a 
                            specific color treatment for respective teams, with the 
                            Swoosh having previously struck deals with the University 
                            of Iowa, University of Kentucky, University of Michigan, 
                            Georgetown, St. John’s, UNLV and Syracuse to confirm the 
                            Dunk High as their teams official shoe.</p>

                        <p>The decade that followed the Dunk High’s first release saw 
                            the sneaker go through some subtle and yet integral changes. 
                            A nylon tongue for the reduction of weight, a shorter shaft 
                            and a thicker swoosh helped the sneaker thud shoulders with 
                            the world of skateboarding, something that Nike itself was 
                            blissfully unaware of at the time. The brand was failing 
                            to comprehend the Dunk’s growing affiliation with skate 
                            culture along with these design changes and was instead 
                            intentionally putting out some laughable sneaker silhouettes 
                            to appeal to this exact same scene.</p>

                        <p>Skateboarders loved the Nike Dunk because it was cheap and 
                            accessible, and offered the cushioning, support and traction 
                            needed for the sport. They were appropriated because of their 
                            durability, cup-sole shape and general construction. They 
                            were also easily styled, a big pro for the community that 
                            was as interested in the sport as it was in the fit accompanying it.
                        </p>

                        <p>Towards the turn of the decade, Nike’s solution to its 
                            skateboarding problem became crystal clear. It was under 
                            its nose the whole time. Skating was beginning to gain in 
                            popularity and importance, and was now influencing the 
                            sales figures of the sneaker industry, especially the 
                            figures of the Nike Dunk. In 1998, the brand revamped the 
                            Dunk High and reissued it in original and familiar 
                            colorways. The design nuances helped push the growing trend 
                            forward, but it wasn’t until 2001 when Sandy Bodecker was 
                            appointed the general manager of Nike SB that the model 
                            successfully infiltrated the industry.</p>

                        <h2 id="SubHeadC">The Dunk's New Era</h2>

                        <p>The new Dunk, as well as being technologically supreme at 
                            the time, also retained a certain aesthetic appeal, 
                            combining the skating shoe with the regular lifestyle 
                            sneaker. This was their discerning appeal in a market full 
                            of conventional skating shoes, a move away from the big, 
                            bulky and non-casual sneaker look of the early 2000s. The 
                            revamped look meant that skaters no longer had to carry an 
                            extra pair of shoes in their bags to swap into after 
                            skating, instead rocking the same SB Dunks throughout the day.</p>
                        
                        <p>The Dunk Low Pro SB dropped in partnership with and inspired 
                            by Nike’s skate ambassadors. In an effort to establish 
                            itself firmly within the culture in a credible manner, Nike 
                            signed its first SB skate team, consisting of Danny Supa, 
                            Gino Ianucci, Richard Mulder and Reese Forbes, and dropped 
                            four signature SB colorways, each sneaker featuring nods to 
                            the associated pro skater. </p>

                        <p>The collection was dubbed the “Colors By” series and 
                            included the Gino Ianucci Long Island New York Dunk, the 
                            Richard Mulder Los Angeles Dunk, the Reese Forbes Wheat 
                            Dunk and the Danny Supa Los Angeles Dunk. Skaters and 
                            sneakerheads were willing to queue for days to get their 
                            hands on a pair from the release. It was clear that this 
                            was the beginning of a long and successful run for the Nike 
                            SB Dunk, now legitimized and greenlit by the skateboarding community.</p>
